Hello there. These are the archives for the front-end of my website, which is in construction. 
The codes you'll see here aren't good, but I'm still working on improving it. I created all this while learning how to use GIT properly, which sounded more complicated than it should.
Note that, if I don't git too often, I'm still trying to figure it out how to git to Github. Thanks
